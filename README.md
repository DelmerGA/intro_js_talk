# Intro To JavaScript


## Outline

We will be exploring the world of JavaScript through a couple different lenses.

* [Analogies and Perspectivesss](#examples/analogies)
  * [Beginners Perspective](#beginner)
  * [Programming Perspective](#examples/primitives)
    * [Control Flow](#examples/js_control_flow)
    * [Intro Functions](#examples/intro_functions)
    * [Intro DOM Events](#examples/intro_dom_events)
  * [jQuery Resources](#examples/intro_jquery)

### Description

In this Intro JavaScript workshop we'll explore the fundamentals of programming through Javascript: data types, variables, loops, functions, objects, control flow, and different kinds of abstractions. We will be learning about events and using functions to handle them. Then we will explore libraries like jQuery, Underscore, and Handlebars — we will build small applications to apply them — and use them to practice good code organization principles.
This class is for students with little to no experience with Javascript who need the fundamentals to kickstart their learning. Those who have some initial understandings of Javascript fundamentals and need practice will also benefit from this class.
