# Intro To JavaScript


## Outline

We will be exploring the world of JavaScript through a couple different lenses.

* [Developer Tools](#examples/tools)
* [Analogies and Perspectives](#examples/analogies)
* [Beginners Perspective](#beginner)
* [Programming Perspective](#examples/primitives)
  * [Control Flow](#examples/js_control_flow)
  * [Intro Functions](#examples/intro_functions)
  * [Intro DOM Events](#examples/intro_dom_events)
  * [Dom Examples](#dom_examples)
* [jQuery Resources](#examples/intro_jquery)

### Description

In this **Intro JavaScript Workshop** we'll explore the fundamentals of programming through Javascript: data types, variables, loops, functions, objects, control flow, and different kinds of abstractions. We will be learning about **events** and using **functions** to handle them. Then we will explore libraries like jQuery, Underscore, and Handlebars — we will build small applications to apply them — and use them to practice good code organization principles.

This class is for students with little to no experience with Javascript who need the fundamentals to kickstart their learning. Those who have some initial understandings of Javascript fundamentals and need practice will also benefit from this class.


| Objectives |
| :---- |
| Learn programming fundamentals and abstractions with Javascript |
| Learn to utilize common JS libraries: Underscore, jQuery, etc. |
| Learn to apply concepts through examples and problem solving |

#### Special Notes

Topics covered like Underscore or Handlebars vary based on the time available and general interests of the students.
