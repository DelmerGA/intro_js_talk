# Intro To JavaScript


## Outline

We will be exploring the world of JavaScript through a couple different lenses.

* [Analogies and Perspectivesss](#examples/analogies)
  * [Beginners Perspective](#beginner)
  * [Programming Perspective](#examples/primitives)
    * [Control Flow](#examples/js_control_flow)
    * [Intro Functions](#examples/intro_functions)
    * [Intro DOM Events](#examples/intro_dom_events)
  * [jQuery Resources](#examples/intro_jquery)

### Description

In this Intro JavaScript workshop we'll explore the fundamentals of programming through Javascript: data types, variables, loops, functions, objects, control flow, and different kinds of abstractions. We will be learning about events and using functions to handle them. Then we will explore libraries like jQuery, Underscore, and Handlebars — we will build small applications to apply them — and use them to practice good code organization principles.
This class is for students with little to no experience with Javascript who need the fundamentals to kickstart their learning. Those who have some initial understandings of Javascript fundamentals and need practice will also benefit from this class.


| Objectives |
| :---- |
| Learn programming fundamentals and abstractions with Javascript |
| Learn to utilize common JS libraries: underscore, jQuery, etc. | 
| Learn to apply concepts through examples and problem solving |

## Sublime

If you don't have sublime installed then you'll want to begin installing now. Once finished, check if the following command works in terminal

```bash
sublime
```

If that opens a sublime editor then you're ready to go. Otherwise we will just use the following command.

```bash
open -a "Sublime Text 3" .
```

You can also just drag a folder from finder over your sublime icon and have it open the project.
