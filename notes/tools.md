### Know Your Shortcuts

Often times you'll need to find something on your computer if you're using a Mac try some of the following:

* Search your Mac using Spotlight

  ```
  CMD + Spacebar
  ```
* Switch between applications

  ```
  CMD + Tab
  ```

Know your special symbols:

* `⌘` (command key)
* `⇧` (shift key)
* `^` (ctrl key)
* `⌥` (option key)

These will come in handy when reading blogs and documentation.

#### Use A Window Manager

Knowing your shortcuts for switching between applications is just part of a good strategy for taming an unruly number of tasks that a developer is managing. With all these tasks happening at once the number of windows will grow quickly and you'll need a good solution for managing them all.

### Text Editing

#### Choose Your Editor: Sublime

If you haven't downloaded Sublime, [download it here](http://www.sublimetext.com/). Then place it on your Mac doc.


Verify you can create a project:

* **Create a folder** on your *Desktop*, and call it `animal_project`.
* Drag the folder and drop it over the Sublime icon on your doc.
* You should see the following:

  <img src="images/tools/new_project.png" width="500" alt="new project">

* Right click the `animal_project` folder, and select `New File`,

  <img src="images/tools/new_file_pointer.png" width="500" alt="new file">

* Type `penguin.html` into the untitled file that opened

  <img src="images/tools/naming_penguin.png" width="500" alt="naming new penguin file">

* Then hit `CMD + s` to save the file to your project, and afterward you should see it in the project directory on the left.

  <img src="images/tools/saved_penguin.png" width="500" alt="saved penguin file">

* Delete the text in the file and type `html`

  <img src="images/tools/html_penguin.png" width="500" alt="typing html into the file">

* Then hit `tab` to see an autogenerated set of boilerplate html.

  <img src="images/tools/boilerplate_penguiin.png " width="500" alt="the boilerplate">

* Type `Hello, world!` into the body of the html

  <img src="images/tools/hello_penguin.png" width="500" alt="hello world text">

* Then *save it* by hitting `CMD+s`. **NOTE THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE A CIRCLE WHEN IT SAVED**. If you see the `X` on the file tab then that means it's been saved.

  <img src="images/tools/hello_saved_penguin.png" width="500" alt="hello world text saved">

* Then open it in the browser by right clicking the file and selecting `Open in Browser`.

  <img src="images/tools/open_penguin.png" width="500" alt="open in browser">
